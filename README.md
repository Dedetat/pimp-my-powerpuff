### Model
> This is about creating our first model

#### [#12](https://github.com/Dedetat/powerpuff-yourself/pull/12/files) - Create the first model and instanciate it
> Write our first model of **Powerpuff**, we can call it `Powerpuff` (damn, clever)
 1. We import `types` from `mobx-state-tree`, this is the most common used API
 2. `types` is used to ... type fields ðŸ‘Œ, we can already use it to describe models ! And  `types.model` is the way to go !
 3. Here we create a model with only one field, a `name` which is a string !
 4. Ok, let's instanciate our model with `Powerpuff.create({})`
    - `Powerpuff` is our model
    - `create` means we instanciate a new tree, a new instance
    - `{}` is the snapshot, the raw data, to use to instanciate a new powerpuff !
 5. Let's print it with a `console.log` !
    - You can see we use `powerpuff.toJSON()` to convert our tree to a snapshot.
 6. ðŸ¤” oups, it doesn't work at all ! This is because, by default, a field is required.
 7. Let's instanciate our powerpuff, it will be... hm... `Rebelle` (this is Blossom in french)
 8. Print it
 9. It works ðŸŽ‰
